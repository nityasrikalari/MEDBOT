  - Thanks for your time. 
  - - You’re welcome. So, what brings you here 
  - Doctor, my father has been diagnosed with abnormal growth of cells in colon,    which doctors so far have confirmed as a case of cancer. 
  - - What tests have you conducted 
  - On the advice of doctors in Lucknow, we conducted blood tests, CT scan, and    biopsy. We’ve taken three opinions on the reports and all have opined colorectal    cancer. Here are the reports. 
  - - Yes, this looks cancerous. What we’ll do is admit him today itself and get few       tests done. And let’s meet tomorrow morning when you’ve the reports of these    tests. 
  - OK. Thank you. 
  - - The cancer is just one stage before it’ll spread to other parts. In this case, the best course of action is immediate surgery to remove the affected part  followed by radiation therapy. 
  - How many days of hospitalization will be required 
  - - We can perform the surgery day after tomorrow. Thereafter, we’ll keep the patient under observation for 4-5 days. Radiation therapy has become pretty standardized and therefore you can get it done in any tier-2 city,which will not only be convenient to you but also reduce your expense. 
  - And for how long the patient will have to undergo radiation therapy 
  - - One dose every two weeks for three months. You need to visit the hospital only on days you receive therapy. Once radiation therapy is done, you should consult an    oncologist every three months in the beginning and every year later on to check    for remission of cancerous cells. 
  - OK. I’ve heard radiation therapy has side effects. 
  - - Yes, radiation therapy has side effects. It can lead to hairloss, nausea, and    loss of appetite. 
  - Thank you doctor. We’ll get him admitted today.
