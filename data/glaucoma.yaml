  - - Good morning doctor.
    - Good morning. How’re you doing today
    - - I’m fine.
    - Thank you.
    - - How about you
    - I’m good. So what brings you here
    - - I’ve come for a regular checkup for a suspected case of glaucoma. I
        don’t have it, but few years back a doctor after examining my eye and
        knowing my family eye history advised me to undergo precautionary
        checkup once a year.
    - I see that your optic nerve is thicker than the normal. That’s probably
      the reason why you were asked to undergo precautionary tests every year.
      You can have the same two tests – visual field analysis and OCT – today
      and once you’ve the two reports, we can meet again in the afternoon.
    - - Alright.
    - Thank you, doctor.
    - - I saw the doctor. He has asked for these two tests.
    - OK. The two tests will cost you 1000 and you’ll get the reports in around
      two hours. Is that fine
    - - That’s fine.
    - Please be seated there. Someone will call you for the first test in few
      minutes.
    - - Thank you.
    - I hope you had a smooth experience going through those tests.
    - - Yes, it was. And because I’ve taken these tests in the past too, I knew
        what was coming.
    - Your reports are absolutely fine. Since these reports haven’t shown
      anything suspect in so many years, I think you can now take these tests
      once in two years, and not once a year.
    - - OK.
    - Well, that puts glaucoma thing to rest. Does your work involve working on
      laptop for long hours
    - - Yes.
    - In case your eyes get tired quickly, I would recommend xxx. It’s an eye
      drop, which you can use 2-3 times in the day. Our eyes get dry  when we
      look at the computer screen without blinking for long, a common reason for
      tiredness in eyes. This eye drop will lubricate your eyes.
    - - Do you’ve any other questions
    - Yes. I see few thin, black, wavy structures floating in front of my eyes
      and they don’t disappear even when I close my eyes. What are they Are they
      harmful
    - - They’re called floaters, and most persons develop them to different
        extent as  they age. They’re not harmful.
    - Thank you doctor.
