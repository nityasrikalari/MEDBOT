conversations:
  - Good morning, what brings you here today?
  - - I am having trouble with my eyes. They have been itchy, sore and watery since last night. I think they are a little bit swollen too.
  - Let me take a look. Your eyes are indeed swollen and red too. Did you scratch them?
  - - I did scratch them because they were itchy.
  - You should never scratch your eyes with your hands, as it is possible that you might transfer germs to your eyes. Whenever you feel itchy or sore, always wash them with cold water.
  - - I did wash them with water and also put some saline eye drops, but all of that was in vain. The itch won’t go away. It has even started to pain.
  - This looks like an eye infection. Many people are having it owning to the weather change. I’ll put some eye drops for now and will also prescribe the eye drops for later use.
  - - Please give me something that will give me instant relief. I wasn’t able to sleep last night because of the pain.
  - Here, open your eyes so I can put the drops. Remember, do not scratch your eye with your hands or any cloth. Use this drops at least four to five times a day and keep washing your eyes with cold water. If you do not get any relief, visit me in the evening.
  - - Thank you, doctor. Hopefully, I will not have to revisit you!
